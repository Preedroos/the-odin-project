        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          This casserole is the perfect winter dinner! It's gone in seconds in
          my house. Make sure to use whole-milk ricotta and use more red pepper
          if you like it hotter.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Set a rack in the
            center of the oven, about 10 inches from the heat source.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add shells and cook,
            stirring occasionally, until almost tender, about 7 minutes. Scoop
            out 1/2 cup cooking water; set aside. Drain pasta in a colander.
            Return to pot and toss with 1 tablespoon oil.
          </li>
          <li>
            Meanwhile, heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil in a large Dutch oven
            over medium-high heat. Add sirloin and sausage and cook,
            undisturbed, until bottom side is lightly browned, about 6 minutes.
            Stir, and continue to cook, stirring and breaking up meat into
            smaller pieces with a wooden spoon, until cooked through, about 4
            minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reduce heat to medium. Add onion and garlic, and cook, stirring
            often, until softened, about 4 minutes. Stir in marinara sauce,
            basil, and crushed red pepper. Remove ragu from heat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stir together ricotta, Parmigiano-Reggiano, cream, and salt in a
            bowl.
          </li>
          <li>
            To assemble, spread about 2 cups of the ragu in the bottom of a 13-
            x 9-inch baking dish. Spoon 1/2 of the pasta over sauce. Dollop half
            of the ricotta mixture over pasta, and sprinkle with 1 cup
            mozzarella cheese. Spoon remaining pasta over mozzarella cheese.
            Spread remaining ragu over pasta mixture, and dollop with remaining
            ricotta mixture. Top with remaining 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese. Cover
            lasagna with a large sheet of aluminum foil that's been lightly
            sprayed with cooking spray (to prevent the cheese from sticking to
            it).
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove from oven and remove
            foil. Increase oven temperature to broil with rack about 10 inches
            from heat source; preheat 5 minutes. Return baking dish to oven.
            Broil until cheese is browned in spots, 5 to 8 minutes.
