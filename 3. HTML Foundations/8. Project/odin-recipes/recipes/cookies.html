        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          Who doesn't like a chocolate striped cookie? These copycat fudge
          stripe cookies taste just like your childhood Keebler favorites - but
          improved with real chocolate and an all-butter cookie. They're made
          with a simple sugar cookie dough that is very easy to work with and
          roll out. I used semisweet chocolate to echo the sweeter taste of the
          Keebler originals, but you can of course use any chocolate you like.

        <ul>
          <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
          <li>¾ cup granulated sugar</li>
          <li>1 large egg</li>
          <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
          <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Combine butter and sugar in a stand mixer and beat with the paddle
            attachment on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes,
            stopping to scrape down sides of the mixing bowl once or twice. Add
            egg, vanilla, and salt; beat until well-incorporated, about 30
            seconds. Reduce mixer speed to low and gradually add flour, beating
            on low until just combined, about 1 minute.
          </li>
          <li>
            Divide dough in half, and flatten each half into a 1/2-inch-thick
            disk. (Disks will be about 12.5 oz. each.) Wrap each disk in plastic
            wrap, and chill until firm, at least 30 minutes or up to 2 days.
          </li>
          <li>Line two baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside.</li>
          <li>
            Working with one disk at a time, roll dough on a lightly floured
            surface to 1/4-inch thickness. If desired, prick the dough with a
            docking tool or run over the dough with an embossed rolling pin to
            create a decorative texture. If you do not have a docking or
            decorating tool, use a meat mallet to emboss the dough: apply the
            mallet textured-side down and lightly tap the center of the smooth
            side with the heel of your hand, and repeat, being sure to line up
            decorative scores.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cut out rounds with a 2-inch round cutter. Place rounds 1-inch apart
            on the prepared baking sheets. Repeat with second dough disk, then
            gather all dough scraps and discard. Using a 1/2-inch cutter or
            piping tip, cut out and remove the center of each dough round to
            create a donut shape. Reserve any extra dough for another use. Chill
            cut-out cookies until firm, about 30 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
          <li>
            Bake cookies, one sheet at a time, in the preheated oven until edges
            begin to brown, about 12 minutes. Cool cookies on the baking sheet
            for 10 minutes. Transfer cookies to a wire rack, and cool
            completely, about 30 minutes. Repeat with second baking sheet.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place chocolate in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on HIGH
            until melted, about 2 minutes, stopping to stir every 30 seconds.
            Transfer 1/4 cup of the chocolate to a piping bag and cut a 1/8-inch
            hole at the end.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place wire rack over a parchment lined baking sheet. Pipe four
            stripes across the top of each cookie. Dip the base of each cookie
            into the bowl of melted chocolate, scraping the excess off on the
            side of the bowl. Place chocolate-side down on a clean
            parchment-lined baking sheet. Chill until chocolate is set, about 10
            minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Store cookies in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to
            4 days.
